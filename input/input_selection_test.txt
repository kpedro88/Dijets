#sections: global options in OPTION, selections in SELECTION, variations in VARIATION, datasets in SET
#option format is: type:name[val] or vtype:name[val1,val2,...]
#available types are (full/abbrev): bool/b, int/i, double/d, string/s, color/c
#items on each line in the SELECTION, VARIATION, and SET sections must be tab-separated, with required items first, in order
#SELECTION/VARIATION: only required item is name, selectors/variators are associated with a selection/variation by tab-indentation
#SET: required items are type (base), subtype (skim), name (but without filenames, nothing will happen)
